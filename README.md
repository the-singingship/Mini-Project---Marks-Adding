# Mini-Project - Marks Adding
Thapar Summer School Projects

This function takes two file names as input:

    input_file: the CSV file containing the roll numbers and marks.
    output_file: the CSV file where the marks will be added and outputted.
The function reads the data from the input_file, calculates the total marks for each roll number, and writes the results to the output_file.
